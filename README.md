# Multi-Agent Simulation Framework

## Overview
This project implements a **multi-agent simulation environment** in Java, where autonomous agents interact, learn, and adapt based on defined strategies and memory. The framework provides flexibility for experimentation and includes a GUI for visualization.

## Features
- **Agent-based modeling** with configurable strategies and memory for adaptive decision-making.  
- **Environment class** to simulate agent interactions and track state changes.  
- **Experimenter module** to run controlled experiments and analyze agent behavior.  
- **Strategy module** supporting customizable agent decision-making rules.  
- **GUI visualization** to observe simulations in real time.  
- **Triple & Memory classes** to support structured state representation and historical tracking.  

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java  
- **Core Concepts**: Object-Oriented Programming, Agent-Based Simulation, Strategy Pattern, GUI Development  

## Setup & Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-agent-simulation.git
   cd multi-agent-simulation
